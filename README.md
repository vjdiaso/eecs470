This is a repository of my EECS 470 out-of-order processor that contains the verilog files for the system, the test benches for data structures, as well as the programs the processor was tested on. Some features were added to improve performance such as 3-way superscalar, a store queue with load-store forwarding, and N-way set associative insturction and data caches.
